# 7509 Mythic Arcade

Info about your project goes here

1. Project Title: Project 7509Mythic, Arcade Game
2. Names of your team members: Kaliana Andriamananjara and Phil Reitz-Jones

3.  Project description:
    1. Give a one-sentence description of your project, so that somebody considering pulling the code knows what to expect.
    > Our game consists of a hub that allows someone to choose to play two games, Set and Werdill.
    2. Give a brief technical guide to running your code:
        1. What are its technical requirements? (At a minimum, it requires that you have Java 17 installed, because that’s what Kilt Graphics requires. Anything else?)
        1. How should somebody run the program? Where is the main class?
            
    > After running the code from Hub, the hub window will appear and show you two buttons: Set or Werdill. You can click either (or both) buttons as many times as you want. It does not need any extra systems or files installed.
    1. Acknowledge any help, references, inspiration, or outside resources you used. If your game includes any art or sound assets, or includes the work of others in any way, credit the creator(s) and link to the source(s).
    > While both games Set and Wordle already exist (Werdill inspired from the New York Times game Wordle and Set, which was created by Marsha Jean Falco), all of the code and graphics are our own. The only visual element borrowed was the hub's geometric background, which was free to use on the internet.
4. Known issues:
    a. Are there fundamental design limitations that users should be aware of?
    b. Are there specific bugs, glitches, or shortcomings that users should be aware of?
    > The shapes and shading in the case of Set are not as distinct and unique as the original Set game. This makes it a bit harder to recognize different possible sets.
5. Societal impact:
    1. Please write about how your project abides by ethical considerations and socially responsible computing practices. Be mindful that anything created by humans, including software, can carry embedded biases and have unintended consequences. In every software project, you must consider the ways in which your program can promote justice or heighten injustices, either through unintentional effects or through malicious misuse.
    This may seem like an odd question. For example, Breakout cannot possibly have negative consequences…right? It is just a game, and such a simple little game at that! But can a blind person play it? What about somebody who uses an assistive device instead of a mouse? Consider equitable practices in software like inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. Think about the ways in which the code you write or software you produce may or may not contribute to society. Here are more specific questions to ask yourself: 
        1. Does your code have the potential to exclude or cause harm to vulnerable populations? 
        2. In what ways do you anticipate your software project being used in malicious and oppressive situations?
        3. Could there be unintended consequences of your software creation?
    
    Note that you do not need to fix every problem you identify. Our goal is for you to develop an awareness of these issues early on in your computing journey. Being able to identify and raise ethical concerns in your software work is an important skill to have. We want you to start developing that skill now.
    > It is true that our project is not particularly accessible. It has no special features or programming to accommodate special HID devices--it can only use keyboard input. In this case, the libraries we used and our skill in Java was probably insufficient to accomplish this. {...}
